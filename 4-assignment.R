######### Homework: Visualizations Using ggplot  ######
#######################################################

#Your homework script and outputs should be contained in a new R Project Folder (contains .Rproj file).
#We want outputs such as figures to be contained in our 'ecosystem'. 


#1. Using the mtcars dataset, make a scatterplot showing the relationship between displacement (predictor)
#and horsepower (response).

#2. Color the points by the number of cylinders.
#hint: If you 'str(mtcars)' you will notice that cyl a continuous numeric variable (either 4, 6, or 8 cylinders).
#use as.factor(cyl) or factor(cyl) to force cyl to be a categorical variable.

#3. Change the axes labels to Displacement (inches^3) and Horsepower. 

#4. Annotate the plot with your name (so I know who made it)

#5. Save the plot to the local directory as a .png file (scripted command).

#6. Make a boxplot showing the distribution of miles per gallon as a function of the number of cylinders.
#hint: you should change the cyl variable from continuous to categorical using as.factor(cyl)

#7. Add the raw data points on top of the boxplots.

#8. Change axes labels to Number of Cylinders and Fuel Economy (miles per gallon).

#9. Change the colors of the boxplot to be something other than the default.

#10. Annotate plot with your name and save the plot to the local directory (scripted command, not a menu button).

#11. Combine your scatterplot from questions 1-5 above with your boxplot from questions 6-10 above into a single 
#figure in which the scatterplot is above the boxplot in a single column.   

# Submit your R Project File to the Assignments area on D2L.
# Your submission should be a NEW folder containing the .Rproj file, the script, and the figure outputs. It should
# be a NEW project folder that you have created, not embedded in my example project from Github. 
# You will have to zip (compress) your project folder before uploading to D2L.
