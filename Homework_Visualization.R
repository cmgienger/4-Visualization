######### Homework: Visualizations Using ggplot  ######
#######################################################

#Your homework script and outputs should be contained in a new R Project Folder (contains .Rproj file).

#1. Using the mtcars dataset, make a scatterplot showing the relationship between displacement (predictor)
#and horsepower (response).

#2. Color the points by the number of cylinders.

#3. Change the axes labels to Displacement (inches^3) and Horsepower. 

#4. Annotate the plot with your name (so I know who made it)

#5. Save the plot to the local directory.


#6. Make a boxplot showing the distribution of miles per gallon as a function of the number of cylinders.

#7. Add the raw data points on top of the boxplots.

#8. Change axes lables to NUmber of Cylinders and Fuel Economy (miles per gallon).

#9. Change the colors of the boxplot to be something other than the default.

#10. Annotate plot with your name and save the plot to the local directory.

# Send me your R Project File; contains the .Rproj file, the script, and the figure outputs.
#You may have to zip before sending, depending on which email program you use.
